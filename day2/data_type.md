Data Types

1. Primitives data types
2. Non-primitives data types

Primitive Data types:

1. Numbers - Integers, floats
2. Strings - Any data under single quote, double quote or backtick quote. 
3. Booleans - true or false values
4. Null - Empty value or no value 
5. Undefined - A declared variable without a value
6. Symbol - A unique value that can be generated by Symbol constructor

Non-primitive data type
1. Objects
2. Arrays

What is the difference between Primitive data type and Non-primitive data type?
Primitive data types are immutable(non-modifiable) data types. Once a primitive data type is created we cannot modify it. Instead Non-primitive data type are modifiable or mutable. We can modify the value after it gets created. 

Strings

Escape Sequences in Strings

In JavaScript and other programming languages \ followed by some characters is an escape sequence. Let's see the most common escape characters:

1. \n: new line
2. \t: Tab, means 8 spaces
3. \\: Back slash
4. \': Single quote (')
5. \": Double quote (")

Template Literals (Template Strings)

To create a template strings, we use two back-ticks. We can inject data as expressions inside a template string. To inject data, we enclose the expression with a curly bracket({}) preceded by a $ sign. See the syntax below.


String Methods
1. length
2. Accessing characters in a string:
3. toUpperCase()
4. toLowerCase()
5. substr(): It takes two arguments, the starting index and number of characters to slice.
6. substring(): It takes two arguments, the starting index and the stopping index but it doesn't include the character at the stopping index.
7. split(): The split method splits a string at a specified place.
8. trim(): Removes trailing space in the beginning or the end of a string.
9. includes(): It takes a substring argument and it checks if substring argument exists in the string. includes() returns a boolean. If a substring exist in a string, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.
10. replace(): takes as a parameter the old substring and a new substring.
11. charAt(): Takes index and it returns the value at that index
12. charCodeAt(): Takes index and it returns char code (ASCII number) of the value at that index
13. indexOf(): Takes a substring and if the substring exists in a string it returns the first position of the substring if does not exist it returns -1
14. lastIndexOf(): Takes a substring and if the substring exists in a string it returns the last position of the substring if it does not exist it returns -1
15. concat()
16. startsWith

Checking Data Types

To check the data type of a certain variable we use the typeof method.

Changing Data Type (Casting)

Casting: Converting one data type to another data type. We use parseInt(), parseFloat(), Number(), + sign, str() When we do arithmetic operations string numbers should be first converted to integer or float if not it returns an error.
