## Conditionals

### If

In JavaScript and other programming languages the key word if is to used check if a condition is true and to execute the block code. To create an if condition, we need if keyword, condition inside a parenthesis and block of code inside a curly bracket({}).

``` 
// syntax
if (condition) {
  //this part of code runs for truthy condition
}
```

### If Else

If condition is true the first block will be executed, if not the else condition will be executed.

```

// syntax
if (condition) {
  // this part of code runs for truthy condition
} else {
  // this part of code runs for false condition
}

```

### If Else if Else

On our daily life, we make decisions on daily basis. We make decisions not by checking one or two conditions instead we make decisions based on multiple conditions. As similar to our daily life, programming is also full of conditions. We use else if when we have multiple conditions.

```
// syntax
if (condition) {
     // code
} else if (condition) {
   // code
} else {
    //  code

}

```


### Switch

Switch is an alternative for if else if else else. The switch statement starts with a switch keyword followed by a parenthesis and code block. Inside the code block we will have different cases. Case block runs if the value in the switch statement parenthesis matches with the case value. The break statement is to terminate execution so the code execution does not go down after the condition is satisfied. The default block runs if all the cases don't satisfy the condition.

```
switch(caseValue){
  case 1:
    // code
    break
  case 2:
   // code
   break
  case 3:
   // code
   break
  default:
   // code
}

```

Example:

```
let weather = 'cloudy'
switch (weather) {
  case 'rainy':
    console.log('You need a rain coat.')
    break
  case 'cloudy':
    console.log('It might be cold, you need a jacket.')
    break
  case 'sunny':
    console.log('Go out freely.')
    break
  default:
    console.log(' No need for rain coat.')
}

// Switch More Examples
let dayUserInput = prompt('What day is today ?')
let day = dayUserInput.toLowerCase()

switch (day) {
  case 'monday':
    console.log('Today is Monday')
    break
  case 'tuesday':
    console.log('Today is Tuesday')
    break
  case 'wednesday':
    console.log('Today is Wednesday')
    break
  case 'thursday':
    console.log('Today is Thursday')
    break
  case 'friday':
    console.log('Today is Friday')
    break
  case 'saturday':
    console.log('Today is Saturday')
    break
  case 'sunday':
    console.log('Today is Sunday')
    break
  default:
    console.log('It is not a week day.')
}


```

### Ternary Operators

Another way to write conditionals is using ternary operators. We have covered this in other sections, but we should also mention it here.

```
let isRaining = true
isRaining
  ? console.log('You need a rain coat.')
  : console.log('No need for a rain coat.')

```
